1. Let it be forgotten, as a flower is forgotten,
2. Forgotten as a fire that once was singing gold,
3. Let it be forgotten for ever and ever,
4. Time is a kind friend, he will make us old.
5.
6. If anyone asks, say it was forgotten
7. Long and long ago,
8. As a flower, as a fire, as a hushed footfall
9. In a long forgotten snow.
10.
11. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
12. And sorry I could not travel both
13. And be one traveler, long I stood
14. And looked down one as far as I could
15. To where it bent in the undergrowth;
16.
17. Then took the other, as just as fair,
18. And having perhaps the better claim,
19. Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
20. Though as for that the passing there
21. Had worn them really about the same,
22.
23. And both that morning equally lay
24. In leaves no step had trodden black.
25. Oh, I kept the first for another day!
26. Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
27. I doubted if I should ever come back.
28.
29. I shall be telling this with a sigh
30. Somewhere ages and ages hence:
31. Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
32. I took the one less traveled by,
33. And that has made all the difference.
